Hello!

This was a group project for Cpt_S 487: Software Design and Architecture.

Outside of planning the development of the game and participating in collaborative development discussions, my contributions were:
- Creating certain sprites seen in-game: rock, mine, bullet, heart, and empty heart
- Created all menu PNGs; menu boxes, buttons, placed all text, etc.
- Making the game UI:
    - All menus (main menu, controls menu, pause menu, endgame win/lose screens)
    - The in-game UI (score, highscore, lives)
- Added initial functionality to the lives system
- Added initial functionality to scoring and keeping track of the highscore
