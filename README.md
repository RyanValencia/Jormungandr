BH STG game made for Washington State University's Cpt_S 487: Software Design & Architecture.

To run the program, open the solution in Visual Studios 2019.
(Note: downloading the project and extracting everything may not be all that's required for the project to run. I've attempted to create the project as an EXE but the process is not straightforward. Feel free to email me if there's any interest in seeing the project and there are compiling issues)

This project was completed by a group of 5 students via Monogame in Visual Studios.

Outside of planning the development of the game and participating in collaborative development discussions, my contributions were:
- Creating certain sprites seen in-game: rock, mine, bullet, heart, and empty heart
- Created all menu PNGs; menu boxes, buttons, placed all text, etc.
- Making the game UI:
    - All menus (main menu, controls menu, pause menu, endgame win/lose screens)
    - The in-game UI (score, highscore, lives)
- Added initial functionality to the lives system
- Added initial functionality to scoring and keeping track of the highscore
